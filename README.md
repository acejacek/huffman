File compressor/decompressor with Huffman coding.

### Features:

- ~~Make archive endian-independent. Now header is created in a way that archives created at x86 won't be read correctly on ARM, and vice versa.~~ [DONE]
- Export Huffman tree in Graphviz format.
- Add additional levels of compression.
- Check code on other architectures.
- Add more verbose compression output (progress bar, ratio, etc.).
